\begin{rSection}{Experience}
{\bf University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill} \hfill {\bf 2019 -} \\
{\bf Research Assistant} \\
Providing research assistance to projects pertaining to the formal verification of safety properties of non-linear cyber-physical systems. Focusing on counter-example generation to aid practitioners in verifying the safety of their models.
\begin{itemize}
\item Created a tool called {\bf Kaa} for the reachability of non-linear discrete dynamical systems using parallelotope bundles. Improved on existing tools for reachablility computation using these techniques.
\item Used parallelotope-based reachability techniques to model COVID disease dynamics.
\item Contributed to the documentation efforts of HyLAA, a verification tool of hybrid automata governed by linear dynamics.
\end{itemize}

{\bf University of South Carolina} \hfill {\bf 2016} \\
{\bf Research Assistant} \\
Published some basic results about fundamental inequalities by remotely collaborating with Professor Wei-Kai Lai from the University of South Carolina, Salkehatchie. \\
\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Services}
  {\bf UNC Cyber-Physical Systems Lunch Organizer} \hfill {\bf Spring 2021}\\
  Organized the Cyber-physical/Real-time Systems Lunch during the Spring 2020 semester. During the lunch, students and faculty involved in Autonomous Systems, Real-Time Systems, Cyber-physical Systems, and Formal Verification met to discuss research and present recently-published papers during an hour-long session.
\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Pedagogy}
{\bf Calculus Tutor} \hfill {\bf 2018} \\
Tutored Calculus to students at South Carolina State University. Stressed geometric intuition and visual approaches rather than rote memorization of formulae and concepts. \\
\\
{\bf Programming Languages Tutor} \hfill {\bf 2018} \\
Provided discussions for South Carolina State University Computer Science students attending summer courses. These discussions pertained to basic programming language concepts in the context of Python, Java, and C. \\

\begin{rSection}{Projects and Software [\href{https://github.com/ekim1919}{Github}]}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Kaa ($>$ 5000 lines, Python)} \\
    Software created to experiment with reachable set computations of non-linear systems governed under discrete polynomial dynamics. The project was specifically created to understand the effectiveness of dynamically-reorienting parallelotope bundles on improving the quality over-approximations of reachable sets. It is the first experimental software created to properly plot the evolution of these dynamic bundle strategies for practitioners to understand the efficacy of different bundle strategies. It significantly improved the usability of previously existing reachable set simulators using these techniques.
    \item {\bf TDAGo (Python)} \\
    Python program to analyze Go games using Persistence Homology for Duke's Topological Data Analysis class. Used the evolution of persistence diagrams to detect topologically-significant features of games played between iterations of Google Deepmind's AlphaGo.\href{https://github.com/ekim1919/TDAGo/blob/master/paper/final.pdf}{ [Link to Report] }
    %\item[Simple Microarchitecture (Assembly)] - Programmed microcode implementing the ISA for a simple microarchitecture completely from %stratch. Includes a program simluating the CPU by clock-cycle to visualize the microcode working.
